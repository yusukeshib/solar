Purpose of this project is to study astronomy by creating a simple view to view stars, planets and satellites and travel space.

### The requirements of the first phase

1) Understanding of basic astronomy from zero
  Investigate a little, and buy books, and read them.

2) Native app using rust

- Native UI app to navigate space world
- Tauri or something?

3) Portable renderer

- Render many stars to some render targets with OpenGL and shaders which should supports WebGL in the future for web
- The renderer must be portable and customizable in the future
